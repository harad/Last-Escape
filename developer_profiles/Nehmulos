Programming history:
I'm currently doing an apprenticeship as programmer.
I didn't publish anything, yet.
-
Currently I'm working on a serialization Library for C++
it's already usable, but may has some bugs.
I would say it's a 0.9 betha.

####
Designer history:
I wrote about 4 design documents and imagined some storylines 
concepts and settings. I prefere offline RPGs and Shooters.
I also spend some time thinking about strategy games & balancing,
but it's not my favourtie genere, because the balancing is very
complex and I allways loose playing strategy games :).

####
Artist history:
I did some Blender tutorials, but didn't come to the animations, yet.
I did some basic GIMP and Inkscape tutorials.
I've got a graphic-Tablet, but I'm not a great artist.
